<p style ="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;"> Here is my website! On the left you can see an image of myself. As I like to frisbee golf, I am posing with my favorite putter. I am an avid fan of heavy metal; I am wearing a Black Sabbath shirt in the image. <br> <br> Besides these two things, I love to play video games and learning programming. I hope to one day program my own video game! I'm not sure if I'd pick this for a career path, but I would defintely like to have my own game I have made. <br> <br> On the right is an image of my favorite video game of all time. If I were to ever program a game I would defintely look to this masterpiece for inspiration! <br> <br> I know there is a stigma against them, but video games have defintely helped me throughout the years and they pushed me to find a career in computer science. Without the in-depth and technical worlds that game developers produce, I would never had been motivated to explore what complexities make up some of my favorite games and the world of computer science!</p>
